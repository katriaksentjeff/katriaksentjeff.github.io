# Data Analyst

## About me

Rookie data-analyst, career-wise formerly known as the neuroscientist who fell in love with statistical modeling and analysis. Above all, I love to answer practical questions or derive practical questions that needs to  be answered. Thus, I dove head-first to my studies in Computing Sciences specializing in Statistical Data Analytics in University of Tampere. Now, I'm ready to start my career and show you my curious way of thinking!

### 1. [Anonymized psychotherapy service providers](https://katriaksentjeff.github.io/Project2/) in Finnish
##### SITUATION
As a master's degree student in Statistical Data Analytics, I keep an eye on the news and trends. Mental health and mental health services have become a more discussed topic in Finland in the past few years. The statistics from Kela show that the number of applicants for rehabilitative psychotherapy is rising annually. Especially there has been mentions about a mental health crisis in Finland due to the resticted access to mental health services.

##### TASK
Aim is to show the current situation in 2022 about Kela accepted psychoterapy providers in case of adult individual therapy in 25 biggest cities in Finland.

##### ACTION
Collected data about Kela accepted psychotherapy providers in the 25 biggest cities in Finland. Data is colleceted from the registry where it is searched by the applicant's hometown. The data contains information about psychotherapy providers for adult individual therapy with four most common psychotherapy types: psychoanalytic, psychodynamic, cognitive, and solution-oriented. After anonymizing and masking the data in Jupyter Notebook using Python it was exported as a csv-file and transferred to Tableau Public.

In Tableau Public, I constructed a dashboard using questions:
1. How many Kela accepted service providers are there in total for the 25 biggest cities?
2. What is the percentage: number of kela accepted service providers/city population?
3. How many psychotherapist can rehabilitative psychotherapy applicant contact depending on their hometown?
4. What is the most common psychotherapy type for the 25 biggest cities?
